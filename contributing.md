Contributing to bitarray
========================

The bitarray type, is very stable and feature complete at this point,
which means that pull requests to `bitarray/_bitarray.c` will most likely
be rejected.

There is room improvements/additions in the `bitarray.util` module,
added in the 1.2.0 release.  However, due to the slow release cycle of this
package, it may be more proactical to create your own library which depends
on bitarray.  This is completely possible, even on the C-level.  Please
study the implementation of `bitarray._util.c` for deatils.  In particular for
C extensions to work with the bitarray type, it is important that
the `bitarrayobject` struct is defined in the same way:

    typedef struct {
        PyObject_VAR_HEAD
        char *ob_item;              /* buffer */
        Py_ssize_t allocated;       /* how many bytes allocated */
        Py_ssize_t nbits;           /* length of bitarray, i.e. elements */
        int endian;                 /* bit endianness of bitarray */
        int ob_exports;             /* how many buffer exports */
        PyObject *weakreflist;      /* list of weak references */
    } bitarrayobject;

    /* member endian may have these values */
    #define ENDIAN_LITTLE  0
    #define ENDIAN_BIG     1
